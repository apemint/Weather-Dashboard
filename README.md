# Weather-Dashboard
weather app that pulls data from openweather api

## Description
Week 6 Weather Dashboard Homework!
For this assignment we were tasked in creating a simple weather app and implementing the openweatherapi to get data and then display it on to the web page.

## Use
[deployed Weather Dashboard](https://apemint.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/)

The user may input a city name into the search bar and click the search button to get current weather information, and a 5 day forecast. The inputed city name is stored locally and displayed on a list below the search bar.
